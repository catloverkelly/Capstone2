# Predicting the Likelihood of Hotel Cancellations
### Springboard Capstone Project #2

Given customer booking information, can we predict who is most likely to cancel their hotel reservation? Furthermore, which features are more likely to contribute to these cancellations?

### The Dataset
The dataset is customer booking information from a city hotel in Lisbon and a resort hotel in Algarve, both in Portugal. It was retrieved through kaggle.com, and the original source is the article "Hotel Booking Demand Datasets" written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.
The dataset contains over 100K rows and 32 columns.
